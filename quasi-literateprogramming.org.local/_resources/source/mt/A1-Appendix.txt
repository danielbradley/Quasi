,,	Appendix A

Quasi uses the following generic auxiliary functions.

...	Create directories

This is a recursive procedure that finds the first existing directory, then unwinds creating the necessary directories.

~c/main.c~
int createDirectories( char* dir )
{
    int success = 1;
    if ( ! directory_exists( dir ) )
    {
        if ( createDirectories( parentDirectory( dir ) ) )
        {
            success = ! mkdir( dir, 0755 );
        }
    }
    free( dir );
    return success;
}
~

...	Directory exists

A simple procedure that determines whether a directory exists or not.

~c/main.c~
int directory_exists( const char* path )
{
    int status = 0;
    DIR* dir = opendir( path );
    if ( dir )
    {
        closedir( dir );
        status = 1;
    }
    return status;
}
~

...	Parent directory

A simple wrapper around "dirname" that allocates and returns a string.
Note: due to /dirname/ returning its own storage, can't just call:
~
    return stringcopy( dirname( filepath ) );
~

~c/main.c~
char* parentDirectory( const char* filepath )
{
    char*  ret = stringCopy( filepath );
    strcpy( ret, dirname( ret ) );
    return ret;
}
~

... Read line

The "readline" procedure reads individual characters into a character buffer --
each character is appended to the char string "line".
When a newline character is encountered "line" is returned.
When the stream is empty a NULL is returned.

If the line is longer than 1023 characters the buffer "line" is doubled in size using "realloc".

Easier to implement this, than worry about portability.
From memory, the POSIX function is implemented differently on different systems.

~c/main.c~
char* readline( FILE* stream )
{
    int  n     = 0;
    int  sz    = 1024;
    char ch[2] = { 0, 0 };
    char* line = calloc( sz, sizeof( char ) );

    int read;
    do
    {
        read = fread( ch, sizeof(char), 1, stream );
        if ( read )
        {
            switch ( *ch )
            {
            case '\n':
                line[n++] = *ch;
                line[n]   = '\0';
                read      = 0;
                break;
            default:
                line[n++] = *ch;
                line[n]   = '\0';
            }

            if ( n == sz )
            {
                sz  *= 2;
                line = realloc( line, sz );
            }
        }
        
    }
    while ( 0 != read );

    if ( 0 == n )
    {
        free( line );
        line = NULL;
    }

    return line;
}
~

... String copy

Returns a copy of the passed string.

~c/main.c~
char* stringCopy( const char* aString )
{
    char* copy = calloc( strlen( aString) + 1, sizeof( char ) );
    strcpy( copy, aString );
    return copy;
}
~

... String prefix

~c/main.c~
int stringHasPrefix( const char* aString, const char* prefix )
{
    return (0 < strlen( prefix )) && (aString == strstr( aString, prefix ));
}
~

... Is AlphaNumeric

~c/main.c~
int isAlphaNumeric( char ch )
{
    switch ( ch )
    {
    case '_':
        return 1;

    default:
        return isalnum( (unsigned char) ch );
    }
}
