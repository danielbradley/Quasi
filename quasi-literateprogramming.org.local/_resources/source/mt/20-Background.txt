.	Background

While this tool was inspired by literate programming, it is derived from an earlier tool called "extract" that is used for extracting SQL definitions from web-application requirements documents for use in database initialisation scripts.
The tool would scan text files and extract the text of pre-formatted sections that matched a user supplied pattern.

For example, this command would extract the following block of SQL:
~
    extract -p "users_table" source_file.txt >> output_file.sql
~

~
    ~users_table~
    CREATE TABLE users
    (
    USER        INT(11)  NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT
    PRIMARY KEY (USER)
    );
    ~
~ 

This allowed the definitions of SQL tables and SQL Stored Procedures to be directly developed and documented within a requirements document.
This provided the motivation for developing a similar tool to also extract source code from documentation.
