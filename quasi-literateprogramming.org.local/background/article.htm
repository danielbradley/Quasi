<h1>Background</h1>
<p class='paragraph'>
While this tool was inspired by literate programming, it is derived from an earlier tool called "extract" that is used for extracting SQL definitions from web-application requirements documents for use in database initialisation scripts.
The tool would scan text files and extract the text of pre-formatted sections that matched a user supplied pattern.
</p>
<p class='paragraph'>
For example, this command would extract the following block of SQL:
</p>
<pre>
extract -p "users_table" source_file.txt &gt;&gt; output_file.sql
</pre>
<pre>
	~users_table~
	CREATE TABLE users
	(
	USER        INT(11)  NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT
	PRIMARY KEY (USER)
	);
	~
</pre>
<p class='paragraph'>
This allowed the definitions of SQL tables and SQL Stored Procedures to be directly developed and documented within a requirements document.
This provided the motivation for developing a similar tool to also extract source code from documentation.
