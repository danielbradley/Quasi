.	Example: quasi implementation

Quasi has now been reimplemented in pure C to maximise portability, allowing it to act as the foundation of an organisation's development tool set.

..		Invocation

To ensure simplicity of implementation, Quasi is invoked with a simple command-line.

~
	quasi [-f] BASE_DIR INPUT_FILES...
~

The /BASE DIR/ argument specifies the directory that target files are created relative to -- if the /BASE DIR/ already exists, Quasi exits returning an error, unless the '-f' flag is passed as the first argument.
After the /BASE DIR/, one or more input files are specified for parsing.

..		Overview

The function declarations below show the overall structure of Quasi.
First the arguments are processed (processArguments) and, if valid, the base directory is verified (canAccessBaseDirectory) and created, if needed.
Each of the command-line arguments corresponding to the source files are then processed (processSourceFile).
During processing, the output files are opened and closed (rejig) as necessary.
Each time a target file is created the filename must be appropriately sanitised (generateSafeFilepath) and it must be determined whether to truncate the file or not (doWeTruncate).

~c/main.c~
int        processArguments( int argc, const char** argv );
int  canAccessBaseDirectory( const char* baseDir, int forced );
int      processSourceFiles( const char* baseDir, int first, int last, const char** files );
FILE*                 rejig( FILE* out, const char* baseDir, const char* line );
char*  generateSafeFilepath( const char* basedir, const char* line );
int            doWeTruncate( const char* line );
~

If inappropriate arguments are passed, Quasi prints a usage message (usage) and exits with an error.
Similarly, if the /base dir/ directory already exists, Quasi prints an error message (*errorDirectoryExists*) and exists with an error.

~c/main.c~
int                   usage();
int    errorDirectoryExists();
~

The following utility functions are also used (these are described in the appendix).

~c/main.c~
int       createDirectories(       char* safeFilePath );
int         directoryExists( const char* path );
char*       parentDirectory( const char* filepath );
char*              readline( FILE* stream );
char*            stringCopy( const char* aString );
~

During argument processing, the following global variables are initialised.
/FORCE/ is initialised as true (1) if the '-f' flag was passed; FIRST is initialised to indicate the first source file argument in /argv/; and /BASE_DIR/ is initialised to the base directory argument.

~c/main.c~
int         FORCE;
int         FIRST;
const char* BASE_DIR;
~

The main function calls the appropriate functions as needed.

~c/main.c~
int main( int argc, const char** argv )
{
	int status = 0;

	if ( processArguments( argc, argv ) )
	{
		if ( canAccessDirectory( BASE_DIR, FORCE ) )
		{
			int last = argc - 1;
			status = processSourceFiles( BASE_DIR, FIRST, last, argv );
		}
		else
		{
			status = errorDirectoryExists();
		}
	}
	else
	{
		status = usage();
	}
	return !status;
}
~

..		Argument processing

If the minimum expected number of arguments is supplied, the arguments are processed.
If the force argument is supplied, the global variable /FORCE/ is set to true (1);
then the global variable /BASE_DIR/ is initialised to the next argument.
Finally, if there is at least one file argument remaining, the global variable /FIRST/ is initialised to identify it and the function returns true (1).

~c/main.c~
int processArguments( int argc, const char** argv )
{
	int status             = 0;
	int expected_arguments = 3;
	int i                  = 1;

	if ( argc >= expected_arguments )
	{
		if ( 0 == strcmp( argv[i], "-f" ) )
		{
			expected_arguments++;
			i++;
			FORCE = 1;
		}
		BASE_DIR = argv[i]; i++;
		FIRST    = i;
		status   = ( argc >= expected_arguments );
	}
	return status;	
}
~


..		Accessing the base directory

First, an attempt is made to create the base directory.
True (1) is returned if this succeeds, or if the directory already existed and /FORCE/ is true.
Otherwise, the method returns false (0).

~c/main.c~
int canAccessDirectory( const char* baseDir, int force )
{
	int status = 0;

	if ( 0 == mkdir( baseDir, 0755 ) )
	{
		status = 1;
	}
	else
	{
		switch ( errno )
		{
		case EEXIST:
			status = force;
			break;
		}
	}
	return status;
}
~

..		Processing the source files

For each source file, the *processFile* function is called passing the /baseDir/ and the /source file/.

~c/main.c~
int processSourceFiles( const char* baseDir, int first, int last, const char** files )
{
	int status = 1;
	int i;
	for ( i=first; i <= last; i++ )
	{
		status &= processFile( baseDir, files[i] );
	}
	return status;
}
~

...			Processing a file

This procedure processes an individual source file.
The file stream *in* is opened for the duration of the procedure, while the *out* file stream is only opened during the processing of a pre-formatted text block.

The procedure reads lines from the *in* stream using the "readline" procedure.
When a tilde (~) character is encountered, the system either opens, or closes, *out* by calling the "rejig" function, which rejigs the *out* stream.
Each time a stream is closed a blank line is printed to the stream -- this allows the source to have spaces between chunks, while not having kludge whitespace in pre-formatted text blocks.

When a tilde character doesn't start the line and the *out* stream is an open (not NULL) stream, the line is written out to the stream.

If the /out/ file stream is not null when the loop exists it indicates that the previous pre-formatted block wasn't closed properly.
This causes a warning message to be printed to /stderr/ and the function returns false (0).

~c/main.c~
int processFile( const char* baseDir, const char* sourceFile )
{
	int status = 0;
	fprintf( stdout, "Processing: %s\n", sourceFile );

	FILE* in = fopen( sourceFile, "r" );
	if ( in )
	{
		FILE* out = NULL;

		char* line;
		while ( (line = readline( in )) )
		{
			if ( '~' == line[0] ) {
				if ( out ) fprintf( out, "\n", line );
				out = rejig( out, baseDir, line );
			}
			else if ( out )
			{
				fprintf( out, "%s", line );
			}
		}
		fclose( in );

		if ( out )
		{
			fclose( out );
			fprintf( stderr, "Warning: %s is unmatched '~'\n", sourceFile );
		}
		status = (out == NULL);
	}

	return status;
}
~

...			Rejig file output

This function closes /out/, then if the passed line contains a valid file name, opens and returns a new file stream.
First, if "generateSafeFilepath" indicates a valid file name, any necessary directories are created, then the file is either opened or created.
If "doWeTruncate" returns true, the file is truncated on open.

~c/main.c~
FILE* rejig( FILE* out, const char* basedir, const char* line )
{
	FILE* ret = NULL;

	if ( out ) fclose( out );

	char* safeFilePath = generateSafeFilepath( basedir, line );
	if ( safeFilePath && createDirectories( parentDirectory( safeFilePath ) ) )
	{
		if ( doWeTruncate( line ) )
		{
			ret = fopen( safeFilePath, "w" );
		}
		else
		{
			ret = fopen( safeFilePath, "a" );
		}
	}
	free( safeFilePath );

	return ret;
}
~

...			Generation of the safe filepath

The "generateSafeFilepath" procedure attempts to produce a safe file path by combining the passed base-dir with a file path extracted from the passed line.
The passed line starts with a tilde character but may have anything else as well.

First, the line is checked to make sure it doesn't include '..', which could potentially reference a directory above the /base dir/.
Next, the line is checked to ensure it includes a period, '.', either indicating a relative directory path, or the beginning of a file type suffix -- this is to avoid MaxText pre-formatted text tags.
Then, 'strtok' is used to tokenise the line using the tilde as a delimiter.
The first token returned is treated as the filepath -- first it is checked to make sure it is alpha-numerical chacter (indicating an appropraite filename), then strtok is called again to verify that the token is trailed by another tilde.

If there are any problems NULL is returned.

~c/main.c~
char* generateSafeFilepath( const char* basedir, const char* line )
{
	char* full = NULL;

	int len = strlen( basedir ) + strlen( line ) + 1;
	if ( NULL == strstr( line, ".." ) )
	{
		if ( NULL != strstr( line, "." ) )
		{
			char* test  = stringCopy( line );	
			char* token = strtok( test, "~" );

			if ( token && ('!' == token[0]) ) token++;

			if ( token && isalnum( token[0] ) )
			{
				full = calloc( len, sizeof( char ) );
				strcpy( full, basedir );
				strcat( full, "/" );
				strcat( full, token );

				if ( NULL == strtok( NULL, "~" ) )
				{
					free( full );
					full = NULL;
				}
			}
			free( test );
		}
	}
	return full;
}
~

...			Truncation

The output file is truncated on open if the source file name is proceeded by an exclamation mark.

~c/main.c~
int doWeTruncate( const char* line )
{
	int truncate = 0;
	if ( 2 < strlen( line ) )
	{
		truncate = ('!' == line[1]);
	}
	return truncate;
}
~

..		Error messages

...			Incorrect arguments

If the program is invoked without the appropriate arguments the following usage message is printed to /stderr/.
~
Usage:
	quasi [-f] BASE_DIR INPUT_FILES
~

~c/main.c~
int usage()
{
	const char* ch = "Usage:\n\t quasi [-f] BASE_DIR INPUT_FILES";
	fprintf( stderr, "%s\n", ch );
	return 0;
}
~

...			Directory already exists

If the force ('-f') flag hasn't been passed, and the base directory already exists, the following error message is printed to /stderr/.
~
	Error: directory already exists, or cannot be created!
~

~c/main.c~
int errorDirectoryExists()
{
	const char* ch = "Error: directory already exists, or cannot be created!";
	fprintf( stderr, "%s\n", ch );
	return 0;
}
