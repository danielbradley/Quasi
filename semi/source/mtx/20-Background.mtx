.	Background

This tool was inspired by a previous tool called "extract" that is used for extracting SQL definitions from web system documentation for use in database set up scripts.
/Extract/ would process text files and would extract the text of the pre-formatted sections that matched the supplied pattern.

For example the following block of SQL would be extracted using a command-line similar to:

~
	extract -p "users_table" source_file.txt > output_file.sql
~

~
	~users_table~
	CREATE TABLE users
	(
	USER        INT(11)  NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT
	PRIMARY KEY (USER)
	);
	~
~ 

This worked incredibly well as the definitions of the SQL tables and SQL Stored Procedures were able to be directly developed and documented within the requirements document.
The success of this got me thinking about whether a similar tool could be used to extract source code from documentation.
