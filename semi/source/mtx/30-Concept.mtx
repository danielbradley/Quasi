.	Concept

Similar to "extract", "semi" extracts sections of pre-formatted text from documentation and appends it to target text files.
Unlike "extract" rather than matching a supplied pattern, the identifier in the pre-formatted text section is used as the file path of the target file relative to a user supplied base directory.

For example, the following command would extract the following block of source code and append it to the file 'source/c/semi.c'.

~
	semi source source/mtx/semi.mtx
~

~
	~c/semi.c~
	int main( int argc, char** argv )
	{
		return 0;
	}
	~
~

The tool does some sanitation of the filenames, checking that parent directory ('..') commands aren't included, ensuring output files remain under the specified base directory.
